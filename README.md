# 🧮 Apple-Inspired AI Calculator

## 📝 Overview
The Apple-Inspired AI Calculator is an innovative project that utilizes OpenCV and Google’s Gemini AI to solve mathematical problems of any complexity. The user can draw the math problem on the screen, and the AI model will interpret the visual input to provide a detailed solution. This project is similar to the Apple iPad calculator but leverages advanced AI technology for enhanced functionality and accuracy.

## ✨ Features
- ✍️ **Draw Math Problems:** Use your finger to draw any mathematical problem on the screen.
- 🖱️ **Move Around:** Move the pointer around the screen by lifting two fingers.
- 🗑️ **Reset Canvas:** Erase the current drawing by lifting the thumb.
- 📤 **Send to AI Model:** Send the visual drawing to the model by lifting the little finger.
- 📊 **Detailed Solutions:** The model interprets the drawing and displays a detailed solution.

## 📋 Requirements
- 🐍 **Python 3.x**
- 👁️ **OpenCV 4.8.0.74**
- ➗ **Numpy 1.23.5**
